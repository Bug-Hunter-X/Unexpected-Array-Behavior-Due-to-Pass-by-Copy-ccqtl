This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Ada related to array copying. In Ada, array parameters are passed by copy, meaning that a copy of the array is created and passed to the subprogram.  This means that modifications to the array within the subprogram do not affect the original array. However, if the programmer is expecting pass-by-reference behavior, this can lead to unexpected results. The `bug.ada` file contains the code demonstrating this, while `bugSolution.ada` shows how to use `access` types to get the desired behavior.
